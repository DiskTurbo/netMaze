# netMaze
 netMaze allows you and up to 15 other players to explore different parts of Cyberspace together through the high-octane competitive Brawl mode or the creative Sandbox mode.


# Looking for the game?
 This is the source code repository for netMaze made available for community modding and learning purposes. If you are looking to download and play the base game, you can visit our itch.io page to grab a copy!

https://netware.itch.io/netmaze

# Installation:
 Just download the repo and open using Unity Hub. We recommend using Unity's latest 2021 LTS build, as we used 2021.3.13f1 during the development of netMaze.
 
 You're going to need your own Photon app ID (get [here](https://dashboard.photonengine.com/)), and optionally your own Unity Gaming Services project ID.
